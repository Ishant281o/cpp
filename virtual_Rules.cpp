    Rules for defining the Virtual functions:-
    1.They cant be static.
    2.They are accessed by object pointers.
    3.Virtual functions can be a freind of another class.
    4.A virtual function in base class might not be used.
    5.If a virtual function us defined in a base class, there is no necessity of reducing it
    in the derived class.
